> Habitat and Adaptation ® Some other adaptations
The place where a living organism lives in

nature is called its habitat. Organisms have certain features suited to their
natural surroundings. Features that help a plant or an animal fo survive in its
natural surroundings are called adaptations.

Plants grow in different habitats. Based on their habitats, plants can be divided
into two groups: terrestrial plants and aquatic plants.

> Terrestrial Plants

Plants that grow on land are called terrestrial plants. Plains, mountains, and
deserts are examples of terrestrial habitats.

Plants in Plains

Plains are some large, flat areas of land. Some plains receive low rainfall, while
others receive heavy rainfall. Due to this difference, the plants growing there
show different adaptations.

Plants growing in plains with low rainfall Mango,
Ashoka, and Gulmohar are examples of trees
growing in areas with low rainfall.

Adaptations

® Trees growing in areas with low
rainfall have many branches.

® Most of these trees shed alll theiny
leaves during the dry season. .§
Therefore, they are called
deciduous trees.
Rubber and teak are examples of
trees growing in areas with heavy rainfall.

Adaptations
® Trees growing in areas with heavy rainfall

have many leaves.

® These trees do not shed all their leaves
during the dry season. They remain green
almost throughout the year. Therefore,
they are called evergreen trees.

SDG 13: Climate Action

(Take urgent action to combat climate

change and its impacts.)

The Dibang valley, located in the northeastern
state of Arunachal Pradesh, is home to a
beautiful evergreen forest with a rich variety of
plants and animals. However, climate change
is fast becoming a threat to the survival of
forests all over the country. Research using
the Internet about ways in which humans

can reverse the damage caused by climate
change. How can we help maintain the

greenery around us?

Mountains are highly raised
areas of land. Mountains are
generally colder than plains. Pine,
fir, and deodar are examples of
trees that grow on mountains.
These trees are flowerless. Instead
of flowers and fruits, they bear
cones with seeds.

Adaptations

e@ Trees that grow on mountains are
usually cone shaped so that snow
can easily slide off their branches.

@ Most trees have small, needle-like
leaves with a waxy coating to
prevent any damage from snow.
Desert plants

— ot

Plants in Deserts

receive very little rainfall. Thus, they are dry. Plants that need very little
water to grow are found in deserts. Cactus and Acacia are examples of plants
that grow in deserts.

Adaptations

® Desert plants have very few or no leaves. Instead, they have spines and
thorns, which prevent loss of water.

® The stem of these plants is thick and fleshy as it stores water.

® Plants such as cactus have green stems that contain chlorophyll. These
stems carry out photosynthesis.

Plants in Coastal Areas

or areas along the seacoast have harsh conditions like rocky and
sandy areas with saline! soil. Strong and salt-laden winds generally blow here.

Adaptations

@ Plants like coconut
that grow here, have
adaptations to
survive in this harsh
habitat.

® Their fruits and seeds
are generally carried
away by seawater
to far off places.

Plants in Swamps

Swamps or marshy areas have clayey soil,
which is sticky and contains a lot of water.
Mangrove plants grow in swamps.

Adaptations

@ Air cannot reach the roots of the
plants growing in marshy areas.
Therefore, they have roots that grow
above the soil. These roots are called
breathing roots.

® Breathing roots also help to absorb water
and minerals that are required to carry
out photosynthesis.

> Aquatic Plants

Plants that grow in water are called
aquatic plants. They are of three
types: floating plants, fixed plants, and
underwater plants.

Floating Plants

Plants that float on the surface of
water are called floating plants.
Water hyacinth and duckweed are oe —
examples of floating plants. Duckweeds

Adaptations
® Floating plants have light and spongy stems so that they can float on water.
® These plants do not have fixed roots. Their roots hang loosely in water.

Fixed Plants

Plants that have their roots fixed to the bottom of a pond are called fixed
plants. They are found in shallow? water. Lotus and water lily are examples of
fixed plants.

Adaptations

@ Fixed plants have flat and
broad leaves. This helps the
leaves to float easily on the
surface of water.

® Their leaves have a waxy
coating. The wax prevents
them from decaying in water.

® Their stems are thin, long,
and hollow. This helps
them to reach the surface
of water.

® Their leaves have stomata
only on the upper surface
of the leaf. Stomata help them
to absorb and release gases.

Underwater Plants

Plants that grow under the surface
of water are called underwater
plants. Tape grass and pondweed
are examples of underwater plants.

Lotus

Adaptations

®) Underwater plants have thin
and narrow leaves.

® These plants do not have a Pondweeds
waxy coating or stomata on their leaves.

2shallow: having little depth
® They absorb and release air into water directly
through their surface.

Some Other Adaptations
Some plants show adaptations for nutrition.

insectivorous
plants. Venus flytrap and pitcher plant are examples
of insectivorous plants. Their leaves are modified to
trap insects.

Insect trapped in
Venus flytrap

Venus flytrap plant has leaves that are in the form of
boxes with hinges. The leaves have hair along their
edges. When an insect sits on the leaf and touches the
hair, the leaf folds and the insect gets trapped.

The pitcher plant has leaves that are in the form of
a pitcher with a lid to cover the mouth of the pitcher.
When an insect sits on the pitcher, the insect gets
trapped.

Pitcher plant

Fact File :

2 |
i 1

» Typically plants grow in nutrient-rich soil, but insectivorous plants grow in soil that
‘is poor in nutrients. So they catch insects and get their nutrition from them. The

pitcher plant, since it eats insects, is also called a carnivorous plant.

non-green plants. The
Indian pipe and coralroot
are examples of non-green
plants. These plants cannot
make their own food. They
absorb food mostly from
dead plants and animals.
