> Teeth
Human beings have two sets of teeth: temporary (milk teeth) and permanent.

The process by which teeth emerge from the gums is called teething.

Temporary set The first set of teeth is called the temporary set or milk teeth.
Most children start developing these teeth from the age of six months. At the
age of three years, they usually have a set of about 20 teeth.

Permanent set Around the age of six, the milk teeth start to fall out. A new set
of bigger teeth starts appearing in their place. This second set of teeth is called
the permanent set of teeth. An adult usually has 32 permanent teeth.

> Types of Teeth

According to the shapes and functions, teeth are of four types: incisors (four
in each jaw), canines (two in each jaw), premolars (four in each jaw), and
molars (six in each jaw).

In children, there are only three types of teeth. They have incisors, canines, and
molars. They do not have premolars. There are eight incisors (four in each jaw),
four canines (two in each jaw), and eight molars (four in each jaw). Thus, they
have 20 teeth in their mouth. In an adult, all the four types of teeth are present.

The structure, function, and number of each kind of tooth is shown in the

diagram given below.

> Parts of a Tooth

Each tooth has a crown and a root. The
part of the tooth that can be seen above
the gums is called the crown. The part of
the tooth that is present inside the gums
is called the roof.Tne gums surround the
teeth and hold them firmly in their place.
A tooth is made up of the following three
main layers:

Enamel It is the outermost layer of the
tooth and is generally white in colour. It is
the hardest part of the tooth.

them properly, food particles may get stuck between the teeth, leading to the

decay and cavities.
