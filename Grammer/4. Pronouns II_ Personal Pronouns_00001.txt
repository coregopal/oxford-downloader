~. “¢ m4 4 Pronouns II:
SN D Personal Pronouns

There are different kinds of pronouns. In this chapter, we shall look at only one of

them: personal pronouns.

These pronouns are called personal pronouns because we use them to refer
(a) to ourselves,

(b) to people we are talking to, and

(c) to people we are talking about.

When we tell somebody something, three persons are usually involved:

(a) the speaker or the person who is saying something;

(b) the person spoken to or the person to whom the speaker is saying something;

(c) the person spoken of or the person about whom the speaker is saying something.

Remember that we are using the word person here in a general sense, that is, to refer
to anything living or non-living.
The king told Ali, ‘I must ask you to
forgive Salim for what he has done.’

1. The pronoun I refers to the

speaker, the king.
2. The pronoun you refers to the

person spoken to, that is Ali, to

whom the king is speaking.
3. The pronoun he refers to the
person spoken of, that is Salim,

about whom the king is telling Ali something.

The personal pronoun I, which refers to the person who

is speaking, is known as the first person.

The personal pronoun you, which refers to the person
who is being spoken to, is known as the second person.

The personal pronoun he, which refers to the person
spoken of, is known as the third person.

The different forms of the three personal pronouns are given in the tables that
follow. Study them carefully.

adjectives.

sometimes in prayers and poems.
