In Chapter 4, we have come across the forms of the personal pronouns that are

known as possessive adjectives and possessive pronouns. In this Chapter, we shall take
a closer look at them.

K possessive Adjectives

Let us begin by looking at some examples:

(a) I have put my old books in a box. (e) Rita has tied her hair with a ribbon.
(b) We love our dog, Simba. (f) The dog was licking its paw.
(c) Where are your new shoes? (g) The children were playing with their toys.

(d) My father has lost his watch.

These words—my, our, your, his, her, its, their—are possessive forms of the personal
pronouns I, we, you, he, she, it, they. They tell us about possession, that is certain
persons have or own certain things, or that certain things belong to certain persons.
(a) My old books belong to me.

(b) Our dog belongs to us.

(c) Your new shoes belong to you.

(d) His watch belongs to him, that is, my father.
(e) Her hair belongs to her, that is, Rita.

(f) Its paw belongs to it, that is, the dog.

(g) Their toys belong to them, that is, the children.

These words are, however, considered to be
adjectives, because they tell us more about or
qualify nouns, like books, dog, shoes, watch, hair, paw, toys, and so, do the work of
adjectives. Moreover, they cannot be used on their own, that is, independently,
without nouns.

You cannot say:

(a) Ihave put my...
(b) We love our ...

(c) Where are your ...
(d) My father has lost his ... es
(e) Rita has tied her ...

(f) The dog was licking its ...

(g) The children were playing with their ...

In each case, a noun—books, dog, shoes, watch, hair, paw, toys—is needed to make the
sense complete. They are, therefore, called possessive adjectives or pronominal
adjectives (pronominal = formed from pronouns).

‘ Possessive Pronouns

Now, look at these sentences:
(h) There are some old books in the box. They are mine.
(i) Have you seen that red car? It is ours.

(j) My shoes are new. So are yours.

(k) There is a watch on the table. It is his.
(1) This is a beautiful dress. Who does it belong to? It is hers.
(m) There is a house on the top of the hill. Is it theirs?

These words—mine, ours, yours, his, hers, theirs—are also possessive forms of the
personal pronouns I, we, you, he, she and they, which tell us that certain persons have
or own certain things, or that certain things belong to certain persons. But note that
they do not depend on nouns. In each of the above sentences, the pronoun has been
used without a noun and the sense is complete. These possessive forms are called

possessive pronouns.

(h) They are mine. (= belong to me)
(i) It is ours. (= belongs to us)
(j) So are yours. (= belong to you)
(k) Itis his. (= belongs to him)
(1) It is hers. (= belongs to her)

(m) It is theirs. (= belongs to them)

The table given below will help you to distinguish between possessive pronouns
and possessive or pronominal adjectives. Study it carefully so that you do not

confuse one with the other.

In Chapter 4, you have already been told that:
e Thy and thine are rarely used, and usually only in poems and prayers.

¢ The form his is used both as a possessive pronoun and a possessive or
pronominal adjective:
(n) This book is his. (possessive pronoun)
(0) This is his book. (possessive adjective)

e The pronoun it has only one possessive form: its and it is
used only as a possessive adjective:

We can say:

The dog wagged its tail.
(4 \)

But we cannot say: 1

The dog wagged the tail of its.

Note: Do not confuse its with it’s —it’s is a shortened form
of it is. This is a very common error. If you want to say that
something belongs to it, you should use its—the proper possessive form (without
an apostrophe) of the pronoun it.

A simple rule that can help you to distinguish a possessive pronoun from a
possessive adjective is that a possessive adjective is always used with a noun and
comes before the noun it qualifies. Since a possessive pronoun does not depend on
a noun, if it is used with a noun, it comes after the noun.

In the sentence — He is my friend—my is a possessive/pronominal adjective and
comes before the noun friend.

In the sentence — He is a friend of mine— mine is a possessive pronoun and comes after
the noun friend.

Given below are some more examples of the way possessive pronouns are used:
(p) This sister of mine lives in London.

(q) He is no friend of yours —he is always speaking ill of you.

(r) I have a book of his and I shall return it soon.

(s) That photograph of hers was taken by her father.

(t) An uncle of ours has written a book on physics.

(u) The last play of theirs was a success and was highly praised.
