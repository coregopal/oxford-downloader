® The Gregorian calendar @ Numbering the years in the Gregorian calendar

® The Saka calendar

We know that a timeline is a line of dates arranged in the right
order. Arrange these dates in the right order to form a timeline.

The first date should be the earliest.

2016 1999 1801
1957 1853 1915

The years that start with ‘20’ are in the 21st century,
for example, the year 2016 is in the 21st century. The
timeline also has years from the 20th and 19th centuries.

THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR

The 19th, 20th and 21st centuries are part of the Gregorian calendar. It is originally
from Europe. For people here the birth of Jesus Christ was the most important event in
history. So the numbering of years in this calendar starts from the time of Christ’s birth.

Put your finger on the year 1 on this timeline and jump forwards until you come to
year 2000. Say the years aloud as you jump.

NUMBERING THE YEARS IN THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR
After the Birth of Christ

The years after the birth of Christ are written with the letters ‘ce’ after them, such as
2000 ce or 1857 ce. ‘ce’ stands for ‘Common Era’. This is the period after the birth of
Jesus Christ. This timeline shows you the time after the birth of Christ.

Some things that happened in the cz period:

e Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869 cE.
e India became independent in 1947 ce.
e You were born in ............-.-.++- CE.

Before the Birth of Christ

History goes back even before the birth of
Christ. To number the years before his birth,
the years are counted backwards from the year 1.

The dotted arrows in the timeline show the direction in which we number the
years, after the birth of Christ and before his birth. Starting from the first year, go
over the dotted lines with a red pencil. First, go forwards and then go backwards.

Start here

Befofe Christ’s birth, the 1 After Christ's birth, the years

‘BCE’ is written for the years before the birth of Christ. This stands for ‘Before the
Common Era’:

All these years are before the birth of Christ. They These years are after the birth of Christ. They
are counted backwards and have ece written after are counted forwards and have ce written

them, such as 100 ace, 500 ace, etc. after them, such as 100 ce, 500 ce, ete.

You will see that in the sce years, 500 sce comes before 100 sce but in the ce years,
500 ce comes after 100 ce.

The Gregorian calendar is now used all over the world.

The Gregorian calendar is named after
Pope Gregory the Thirteenth, who
finalized it over 400 years ago.

SAKA CALENDAR

After Independence, it was decided that the Saka calendar would be India’s
national calendar. It is used along with the Gregorian calendar. The similarities and
differences between these two calendars are:

¢ Both the Gregorian and Saka calendars are based on the movement of the earth
around the sun. They both have 365 days in a year and 366 days in a leap year.
You will learn about leap years in a later chapter.

¢ Both have 12 months. January is the first month of the Gregorian calendar and
Chaitra is the first month of the Saka calendar.

e The starting point of the Gregorian calendar is the year 1 but that of the Saka
calendar is 78 ce of the Gregorian calendar. A date in the Saka calendar is
always 78 years less than the date in the Gregorian calendar.

&ij ¢ Write the Gregorian calendar year here: ..........ssssceneeee
¢ Subtract 78 from this number. This is today’s Saka year: .............eeeee

Calendars were needed so that people could plan activities like farming or festivals.
We also know how useful calendars are.

The Calendar Reforms Committee, set up soon after Independence, identified more than
30 different Indian calendars being used all over the country!

e Why are timelines important?
e Why do we need to understand how the years are counted?

REMEMBER @

1. The Gregorian calendar uses the birth of Jesus Christ as its starting point.

2. The years after the birth of Christ have ce (Common Era) written after them.

3. The years before the birth of Christ have sce (Before the Common Era) written

1. Find the year 1 in this picture of a timeline.
2. What colour are the sce years?
3. Which colour are the ce years?

Make this timeline with a partner.
You will need: a long strip of brown paper, graph paper, crayons, ruler, scissors, glue
and a black felt pen

What to do:

1. On the graph paper, mark three squares equal to 100 years. Count 20 sections like
this. Cut the graph paper. These are your cE years.

2. For the Bce years, again make
three squares equal to 100 years.
Count five sections. Cut the
paper.

3. Colour the two strips with two different colours.

4. Draw a long straight line on the brown paper.

5. Paste the two strips on the line jg) r.  —

6. Draw a black line between the strips where the two colours meet. Mark this as ‘1’.

7. Starting from 1, count three squares each and mark the ce years—100, 200, 300
and so on until 2000.

8. Mark the sce years, starting from 1 up to 500.
